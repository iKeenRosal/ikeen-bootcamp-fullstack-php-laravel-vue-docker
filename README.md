# Bootcamp: Fullstack PHP + Laravel + Vue + Docker  
*A beginner-friendly coding journey designed for adults with no technical background.*

Welcome to the **Bootcamp Fullstack PHP Laravel Vue Docker** repository!  
This project accompanies the **8-Month Fullstack Learning Guide** and provides all hands-on lessons, exercises, Docker environments, and fullstack projects needed to grow from absolute beginner → fullstack junior developer.

This learning roadmap was created especially for adults switching careers — including learners from health, wellness, acupuncture, retail, or other non-technical fields — who can only commit **30 minutes to 1 hour per day**.  
The pace is realistic. The projects are fun. The challenges gradually build confidence.

## ❤️ A Personal Note (for new learners)

Learning programming can feel overwhelming — especially if you're coming from a completely different field.
But remember:
- You don't need to be perfect. You just need to be consistent.
- Mistakes are expected and valuable.
- You are not “bad at tech.” You’re simply new.
- Ask for help anytime — no shame.
- Use resources: PHP.net, Laravel docs, Vue docs, ChatGPT, YouTube tutorials.

If you stay patient and keep practicing a little each day, you will grow into a capable fullstack developer.

 #### 🚀 Ready to Start?

Download the PDF, open Month 01, and begin coding. The journey is long—but achievable, structured, and designed for your success.

Let’s do this.
